# performance-monitoring
This repository aims to keep a fully serverless, cloud-native platform for continuous performance testing and monitoring. This solution automatically runs K6 load tests, archives results in Amazon S3 organized by date/time, evaluates metrics against predefined thresholds, and triggers alarms when performance degrades.
